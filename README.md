# Gametime
My team and I developed an Android app using the agile methodology in our software engineering course in the spring 2021 semester. Teammates: Anaz Mohammed, Carlos Meza, Alfredo Lepe, Ibtehaz Utsay, James Maturino, and myself. This project was an android app that looked to make setting up pick up games at local parks and sports fields easy. It has features such as profile creation, event creation, and event log. Although we didn't have much time to finish the whole project as it was a little ambitious, we were able to get profile creation and event creation done by linking our application with a Google Firebase database.

My contributions:
I worked on the User Profile section and integrating the current logged in users data from the database. This was to construct all their stats from the events they attended.
